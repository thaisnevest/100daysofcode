## My Daily Progress

---

### Day 1 - September 25, 2024

**Today’s Progress**: On my first day, I studied more HTML. Although it's something I'm already familiar with, I believe it's the foundation for becoming a great programmer, so I focused on HTML with an emphasis on optimizing it using Emmet.

### Day 2 - September 26, 2024

**Today’s Progress**: Today I focus on learning a little more about React as it is one of the most used libraries in my daily work.

### Day 3 - September 28, 2024

**Today’s Progress**: I decided to code the CITi's FAI challenge and today I worked on componentization, striving to try something new which is inline styling. I also studied a little and became more familiar with Next 14.

### Day 4 - September 29, 2024

**Today’s Progress**: Today I still focused on the components of FAI's challenge, and I realized that this is going to take a while because there are a lot of components to do and I'm still remembering how to style - MUI mainly - because it's been a while since I've worked on it, but I think my knowledge curve it's very good. I'm thinking about starting the backend soon as it's something I'll need to study a little more

### Day 5 - September 30, 2024

**Today’s Progress**: I continued doing the FAI's challenge even though I made a terrible mistake by using the wrong prototype, so I made the mobile component. I think I'm getting more familiar with React every day and today I felt happy doing this challenge because I reinforce that I love what I do. Thinking about finishing all the components and starting the backend this week
