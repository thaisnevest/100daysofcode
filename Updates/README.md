## My Daily Progress

### Day 1 - September 25, 2024

**Today’s Progress**: On my first day, I studied more HTML. Although it's something I'm already familiar with, I believe it's the foundation for becoming a great programmer, so I focused on HTML with an emphasis on optimizing it using Emmet.

### Day 3 - September 28, 2024

**Today’s Progress**: I decided to code the CITi's FAI challenge and today I worked on componentization, striving to try something new which is inline styling. I also studied a little and became more familiar with Next 14.
