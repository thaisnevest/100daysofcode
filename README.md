### What is #100DaysOfCode?
The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a commitment to code for at least one hour every day, for 100 consecutive days. The goal is to improve your coding skills through consistent practice and share your progress with the community.

### Why am I doing this?
I've decided to take on this challenge to:

- Improve my skills in full-stack web development.
- Build real, practical projects.
- Develop consistency and discipline in my coding routine.

### How You Can Follow My Progress
I will be sharing daily updates on this repo.

### Technologies & Tools
Here are the technologies and tools I'll be using throughout the challenge:

- Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS

- Other Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code
  
### Personal Rules
In addition to the official rules of the challenge, here are some personal rules I've set to keep myself on track:

- Code for at least 1 hour per day, no excuses.
- Share progress daily on this repo.
- If I miss a day, I'll continue the next day without restarting the count.
- Focus on quality over quantity. I prefer deep learning over rushing through tasks.

### Conclusion
I’m really excited to start this journey! If you're participating in the #100DaysOfCode or are interested in web development, feel free to follow my progress and connect with me.

Let's do this together!  ๋࣭ 𖤐 ‧₊💿˚ ⋅
